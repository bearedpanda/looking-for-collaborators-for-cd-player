I am looking for 12 collaborators on my private github repository.

It uses C/C++ and Raspberry Pi Zero and it's a CD (all variants excluding CD-i), DVD (all variants excluding DVD-RAM and HD DVD) standalone player (no screen included).

If you accept please send your github username by commenting to [Issue #1](https://github.com/bearedpanda/looking-for-collaborators-for-cd-player/issues/1) and I'll add you to my repo.

I will not give you money as a reward.

**DO NOT**:
- Use AI
- Use prebuilt libraries for reading CDs/DVDs
- Violate licenses of libraries
- Use copy-pasting
- Use examples
